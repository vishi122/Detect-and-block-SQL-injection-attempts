# Detect-and-block-SQL-injection-attempts
Architecture Overview
Amazon Cognito: Handles user authentication and ensures only authorized users access the application.
AWS WAF: Detects and blocks SQL injection attempts at the application layer using rules.
Application Layer: Implements validation and logging mechanisms to detect potential SQL injections.
Amazon RDS: Stores sensitive application data securely and logs database queries for monitoring.
Amazon SNS: Sends alerts when SQL injection patterns are detected.
AWS SAM: Automates the deployment of Lambda functions, WAF rules, and infrastructure.

Step-by-Step Design
1. User Authentication (Amazon Cognito)
Purpose: Authenticate users and provide secure access tokens.
Steps:
Create a Cognito User Pool for user sign-up and sign-in.
Create an App Client for the application and configure token expiration policies.
Use Cognito Identity Pool to issue temporary credentials for accessing AWS resources.

2. Database Setup (Amazon RDS)
Purpose: Store application data securely.
Steps:
Launch an Amazon RDS instance with encryption enabled.
Use IAM authentication to connect securely.
Enable database activity streams for monitoring queries.
Restrict public access and configure the security group to allow connections only from trusted sources (e.g., the application server).

3. Application Layer
Purpose: Validate user inputs and log database queries.
Steps:
Use a secure framework that prevents SQL injection (e.g., prepared statements in Python, Java, etc.).
Implement input validation to sanitize and validate user inputs before they are sent to the database.
Log all database queries with metadata (e.g., user ID, query time) to a CloudWatch Logs group for further analysis.

4. Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF)
Purpose: Detect and block SQL injection attempts.
Steps:
Attach an AWS WAF WebACL to the application’s API Gateway or CloudFront distribution.
Create SQL Injection Rules using AWS Managed Rule Groups:
AWS-AWSManagedRulesSQLiRuleSet: Blocks common SQL injection patterns.
Configure logging for WAF to a CloudWatch Logs group.

5. Alerting System (Amazon SNS)
Purpose: Notify administrators about potential SQL injection attempts or data leaks.
Steps:
Create an SNS Topic for alerts (e.g., "SQLInjectionAlerts").
Subscribe administrators via email or SMS to the topic.
Set up a CloudWatch Alarm that triggers the SNS topic when:
WAF detects a SQL injection pattern.
Query patterns in database activity streams match suspicious behaviors.

6. Automation with AWS SAM
Purpose: Automate deployment and ensure consistency.
Steps:
Create a template.yaml file defining resources:
Lambda functions: Process logs and detect anomalies.
WAF WebACL: Attach SQL injection rules.
RDS instance: Configure database settings.
SNS Topic: For alerting.
Deploy using sam deploy --guided.
